The UAV-Assisted Edge Computing System is a comprehensive simulation framework aimed at improving task offloading and processing efficiency in mobile edge computing (MEC) environments with the help of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The system addresses several core challenges in edge computing—such as optimal UAV placement, energy-aware computation, secure data exchange, and intelligent load distribution.
Using K-Means clustering, the system determines the optimal positions for UAV deployment based on user density, minimizing latency and communication overhead. AI-based load balancing dynamically assigns computational tasks to either UAVs or ground-based edge servers, ensuring balanced resource utilization even in changing network conditions. The system incorporates parallel processing and energy tracking for each UAV, allowing for efficient task management while monitoring power consumption in real time.
Security is reinforced through blockchain integration, which ensures the integrity and confidentiality of task data and communication between devices. For better understanding and diagnostics, the system includes a real-time dashboard built with Matplotlib that visualizes key performance metrics such as energy usage, task completion time, node load levels, and system throughput.
This project is particularly useful in scenarios such as disaster response, smart agriculture, military surveillance, and rural connectivity—where fixed infrastructure is unavailable or insufficient. Its modular design and use of open technologies make it adaptable for both research and applied development in edge intelligence.
